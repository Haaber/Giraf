\section{TextToSpeech}
The main task of this sprint, for our group, was to get the Pictoreader back to a working state. At the start of this sprint Pictoreader was not able to play sound from a pictogram, this was because Google translate had added a CAPTCHA and it was not possible to make a call to the web service. The problem with the Google translate is that it require a Internet connection, this was a problem as there might not be internet all the time that Giraf is used, so a alternativ that did not use internet was found, namely the Google TextToSpeech API.
